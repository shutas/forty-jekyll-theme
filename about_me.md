My name is Shuta Suzuki, and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. I am currently majoring in computer science and minoring in linguistics. My interests include natural language processing, web development, and user interface/interaction.

I currently work as a research assistant at BioSocial Methods Collaborative located inside the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research. I contribute to multiple interdisciplinary research projects in biology, psychology, physiology, and social sciences primarily through software programming or new technology integration.

In my free time, I enjoy watching YouTube, playing chess, and eating tempura udon.

I just finished one of my final exams this morning, so I thought I'd come here and give you a little update on what I've been up to recently:)

As some of you may have noticed already, I got a new domain name!!! (Or what a lot of people call the "address" of a website, if that sounds more familiar to you) This website can now be accessed by its custom domain [shutasuzuki.com](https://shutasuzuki.com) and so far, it's looking great! I bought this domain through [Google Domains](https://domains.google) for $12/year. Not a bad deal, right?

(Seriously tho, you buy a domain just like you buy anything else online. I literally clicked "Check Out" and provided the method of payment after this screen and I was DONE.)

So my website was previously hosted on [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) because they gave me a free subdomain when I first deployed it on their platform, but I wanted something a little more "official", if you know what I mean. Plus, Netlify makes the migration to a custom domain nice and simple. Just add your custom domain to their DNS record and configure your domain's nameserver. Easy peasy. And you just wait. And wait. And wait until your new DNS info gets propagated through the world of internet as ISP nodes update their cache to include your most recent DNS data... Basically, it takes a couple hours. Or maybe a day if you're a little unlucky.

And there you have it. Your website with a name just the way you like it! I'm probably going to see you all after this week since I'm packed with finals until the end of the week. RIP my GPA.

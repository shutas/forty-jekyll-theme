Have you noticed that we (programmers) are extremely polite? Of course we are! Whenever we meet a new programming language or technology for the first time, we start our journey by greeting to the world. And this website is no different: this is my first time deploying a personal website for the whole world to see! So let me open this blog post with a big, loud "Hello World!"

(Wow that's a BIG picture if you're looking at this on a computer! By the way, that's me)

Hopefully, you had a chance to visit my [About Me](about_me.html) page where you learned a little bit about myself. But in case you haven't, my name is Shuta Suzuki, and I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan studying computer science and linguistics. When I am not in my classes, I enjoy participating in club activities and working as a research assistant at a research lab.

Some of you may relate, but life as a computer science student is very, very, VERY busy, so I don't plan on writing a blog entry every single day. Maybe once a week. Or once a month. Well, maybe a few times a year. I don't know, but I don't want to make any empty promises so I will not make any bold statements here.

I honestly don't have a clear plan of what to write in these blog posts, but I am sort of envisioning this to be a platform where I share my recent experiences with computer technologies or just some fun times in my personal life. Probably both. So keep coming back! I will see you very soon in my next blog post.

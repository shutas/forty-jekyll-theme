(Wow that's big!)

We programmers are exceptionally polite. Whether it is our first time writing a computer program or just trying out a new technology, we start our journey by greeting to the world. In fact, this website is yet another journey that just launched today: my very own static, personal website powered by Jekyll and Netlify. And so I will do the same... "Hello World!"

Let me warn you that this is technically not my first personal website. In fact, this is my second one. The first one used to live in my university's server, and it is was created solely for educational purposes only: I coded EVERYTHING from scratch. From defining the structure using HTML to stylizing the page using CSS to animating objects using JavaScript, it was a product of hard work and hours spent working on the website. But you can only do so little, especially when you are a full-time student studying day and night, all year long.

How did I end up here? Well, that is going to be my next blog post.

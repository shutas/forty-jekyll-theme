Let me start out by expressing how happy I am for finishing up all of my final exams last week! Fortunately, I passed all of my classes which means I'm still on track for graduating next spring. I hope senioritis won't hit me too early...

Anyways, I finally published the Japanese version of this website today! Here is a screenshot of the Japanese version of my current homepage:

This new addition to my website is a LARGE update with respect to content and server-side code, so there are probably a bunch of bugs lurking behind (I am already aware of a few of them. If you find something peculiar, let me know through the form below!). I will keep making small changes to perfect it!

You can access my Japanese homepage [here](https://www.shutasuzuki.com/ja/). You can also access the Japanese version of the webpage you're on by clicking "日本語" (literally "Japanese" in Japanese!) under MENU. Conversely, you can switch back to the English version by clicking on "English" under MENU.

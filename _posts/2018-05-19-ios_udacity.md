Recently, I decided to take a course on Udacity called "Swift for Developers." This is my first time using Udacity, and so far, I am very pleased with my experience! The course is structured in a very organized matter, and the design is very clean and nice.

I chose to take this course because I will be taking a class on mobile app development next fall, so I wanted to get a little head start by exploring what I will be getting myself into in the next few months. After I take this course, I hope to create a small app in my own free time as another side project. If this ever becomes a reality, I will follow up with you guys in the future!

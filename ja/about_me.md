こんにちは！鈴木秀汰と申します。
My name is Shuta Suzuki, and I am an undergraduate student at the [University of Michigan - Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu){:target="_blank"}. I am currently majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/){:target="_blank"} and minoring in [Linguistics](https://lsa.umich.edu/linguistics){:target="_blank"}. My interests include natural language processing, web development, and user interface/interaction.

I currently work as a Research Assistant at [BioSocial Methods Collaborative](http://biosocialmethods.isr.umich.edu/){:target="_blank"} located inside the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research. I contribute to multiple interdisciplinary research projects in biology, psychology, physiology, and social sciences primarily through software programming or new technology integration.

In my free time, I enjoy watching YouTube, playing chess, and eating tempura udon.
